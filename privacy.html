        <h1>Privacy Policy for Blackboard Sync</h1>

        <span>Effective Date: 2024-08-21</span>

<p>
Thank you for using Blackboard Sync!
Your privacy is very important to us.
This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled
when you use our application.
</pre>

<h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>

<p>
Blackboard Sync does not collect, store, or process any personal data.
The app functions as a client for Blackboard Learn, which means that
all interactions and data transactions are conducted directly
between you (the user) and Blackboard Learn.

Any information you share, post, or transmit is sent directly to your
chosen instance of Blackboard Learn, and the developers of this application
have no access to or control over this data.
</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
Since the application acts solely as a client for Blackboard Learn,
we do not integrate any third-party services or trackers that collect
or process your data.

Any data processing is handled in accordance with the privacy policy
of Blackboard Learn, which we encourage you to review to understand
how your data is handled by their platform.
</p>

<h2>3. Security</h2>

<p>
Although we do not collect or store your data, we are committed to
ensuring that your experience using Blackboard Sync is secure.
Any concerns about the security of your information should be directed to your
educational institution.
</p>

<h2>4. User Data Rights</h2>

<p>
Since Blackboard Sync does not collect any personal information,
we do not manage any data rights requests
(such as requests for access, correction, deletion, etc.).

All such requests should be directed to your educational institution as
they are the data controller for any information processed via their platform.
</p>

<h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
If we make changes, we will update the effective date at the top
of this document.
We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed
about how your information is protected.
</p>
